Nagar Drishti AI
हर समस्या का स्मार्ट समाधान (Smart solutions for every problem) 


Nagar Drishti AI is a citizen-centric digital governance platform designed to bridge the gap between urban residents and local government bodies. It transforms the traditional, manual complaint process into an automated, transparent, and AI-driven workflow. 




#📌 The Problem
Urban local bodies currently struggle with managing civic infrastructure like potholes, water leakages, garbage accumulation, and faulty streetlights.  Existing mechanisms are often:
Manual and Slow: Relying on paper or basic digital forms without intelligent routing. 
Lack of Transparency: Citizens cannot track the real-time status of their reports. 
Inefficient Prioritization: Complaints are often handled on a first-come, first-serve basis, regardless of how dangerous the issue is to public safety. 

#💡 The Solution
Our platform enables civilians to report issues by uploading real-time images along with location details. The system then uses AI Logic to automatically classify and prioritize these complaints based on urgency, ensuring that safety-critical issues (like deep potholes or major leaks) are handled first. 

#🚀 Key Features
For Citizens 
Secure Login: Private account management for tracking personal reports. 
Image-Based Reporting: Visual evidence submission to reduce ambiguity. 
Location Input: Precise address/location details for field teams. 
Real-Time Tracking: Watch the status of your complaint move from "Pending" to "Resolved." 


For Government Officials
Centralized Dashboard: A single "Real-Time Analytics" interface to view all active reports. 
AI Prioritization Engine: Issues are automatically tagged as High, Medium, or Low priority based on severity. 
Visual Evidence: Review uploaded images to assess the situation before dispatching teams.
